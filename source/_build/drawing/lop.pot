msgid "QElectroTech is not only a tool for diagrams and shemas, QElectroTech allows also drawing 2D drawings. Electrical boxes, buttons, switches, screens and any other type of components can be drawn at the `workspace`_."

msgid "2D drawings from electrical component can be created at the `element editor`_ as `elements`_. After the creation of component drawings, assembled panel drawings can be created introducing the `elements`_ at the `workspace`_. At the category **Graphics** from `QET collection`_ some common electrical components front views are provided as `elements`_."

msgid "The advantage of drawing control panels using QElectroTech and not with a different CAD tool is the posibility to create links between the `elements`_. A link between the `elements`_ which represents the electrical component at the `schema`_ and the `elements`_ which represents the component at the drawing will reduce the future effort; the effort from the manufacturing, intallation and maintenace phase of the project."
